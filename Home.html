              I left Fordham in 2010, and began to work as a full time horse wrangler and trainer on a variety of different farms and ranches. The five years between 2010 and 2015 were amazing: I rode for countless hours, trained and interacted with thousands of horses, and was granted the opportunity to travel around the country offering clinics, buying and selling horses, and exploring much of this nation's beautiful natural parklands.
